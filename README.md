<h1>
Miscellaneous Scripts From Hallanger
</h1>

Welcome to my personal repository where I store the random scripts and projects that I make.

I am by no means professional with coding and these scripts and projects are more experimental in nature.

<h2>
OMP-Installer
</h2>

OMP or Oh-My-POSH (PowerShell) is a custom installation script I created to quickly install the Tokyo style for the terminals between both Linux and Windows...
I forget how reliable it is for installing, I know it works for BASH at the least.

<h2>
OTW-Bandit
</h2>

OTW-Bandit or Over-the-Wire Bandit is a simple script that was supposed to automate the process of logging into the Bandit Wargames at Over the Wire...
But due to the nature of the game itself, there are many more rules that would need to be implemented for full functionality.

<h2>
Stanley-Parable-Tex-Adventure
</h2>

It is as it sounds, I decided to re-create The Stanley Parable (not ultra deluxe edition) as a text adventure with a single Python script.
The project was made for a class that I put way too much effort in for an introductory 'If-Else' assignment.
Of course, with changes to adhere to the text based format.
