<h1>NerdFonts for RedHat</h1>
For some distros, you may need to install and apply nerd fonts to get the icons to function properly.
Known issue on RockyLinux9.

For this I recommend this guide.
https://docs.rockylinux.org/books/nvchad/nerd_fonts/

I substituted his git copy/paste to ```git clone --filter=blob:none https://ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git```
Following his guide they will give you a website to observer, which has other nerd fonts.
For my OMP_TOKYO script, I use "HACK" instead of IBMPlexMono.
